00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Game Overview. This game is a simple tower defense experience.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,760
The player places turrets along a predefined path to stop incoming enemies from reaching the base.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,840
Each enemy that is defeated rewards the player with coins.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,320
Coins can be used to place new turrets or upgrade existing ones.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,520
If an enemy manages to pass through the entire path, the player takes damage.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,200
When the player's health reaches zero, the game is over.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,280
Turret system. All turrets in the game are based on a shared base turret.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
This turret provides basic functionality such as range,

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,680
fire rate, and cost. There are two advanced turret upgrades.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,640
One, machine gun turret, fires faster than base turret.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,600
Two, sniper turret has bigger range than base turret.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
Instead of creating completely separate turret classes,

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
upgrades are applied dynamically using the decorator pattern.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,720
This means that every turret in the game is fundamentally a modified version of the base turret.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,440
Decorator pattern. The decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to an object at runtime

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,440
without modifying its original class.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,920
In this game, each turret upgrade is implemented as a decorator.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,240
A decorator wraps an existing turret and modifies its stats.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,200
Already placed turrets can be upgraded without replacing them.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,880
By using the decorator pattern, turret upgrades remain modular and stackable,

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
while the core turret logic stays clean and reusable.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,360
Visualization. When a turret is upgraded using the decorator pattern,

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,000
its appearance changes to reflect the new behavior.

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,240
Upgrading a turret to a machine gun changes its color to blue.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,560
This visually informs the player that the turret now fires faster.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Upgrading a turret to a sniper changes its color to red.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,240
The sniper upgrade represents the highest tier of enhancement.

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,080
If a turret was previously upgraded to a machine gun,

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,840
and is then upgraded to a sniper, the turret becomes red,

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,320
but still has increased fire rate.

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,080
When the player moves the mouse cursor over a turret,

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
its attack range is displayed directly on the map.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,960
This allows the player to quickly evaluate turret placement and coverage.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,720
The firing speed of a turret is not shown as a number.

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Instead, it is communicated naturally through gameplay.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,800
The faster a turret fires, the easier it is to perceive its fire rate through observation.
