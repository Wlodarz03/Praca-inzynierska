00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Game overview. This game is an endless top-down shooter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The player can move only left and right, while enemies continuously spawn from a factory located at the top of the screen.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The player shoots enemies using the mouse, and gradually becomes stronger by dealing more damage and firing faster over time.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Enemies are spawned through a conveyor belt-like system.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This ensures smooth, predictable entry into the play area, and prevents sudden or unfair spawns.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Once the enemy reaches its spawn point, it becomes fully active and begins chasing the player.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Escalating difficulty. As the game progresses, enemy waves become larger and more frequent.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Early waves may contain only a few enemies, while later waves spawn many enemies at once and move at higher speed.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Enemy variety. The game features three different enemy types.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Each type has unique characteristics, such as different movement speeds and health values.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
All enemies inherit from a shared base class. This allows the factory to treat every enemy in the same way, even though each one behaves differently.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
New enemy types can be added simply by creating a new subclass and registering it in the factory.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
About factory pattern. A factory is a dedicated object responsible for creating other objects at runtime.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Instead of instantiating enemies directly, the game requests them from the factory.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The factory hides all details related to enemy creation.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It decides which enemy type to spawn, where it should appear, and how it should be initialized.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The factory works together with an object pool to reuse enemies instead of constantly creating and destroying them.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When an enemy is needed, the factory retrieves it from the pool, configures its type and behavior, and places it into the game world.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When the enemy is defeated or leaves the screen, it is returned to the pool for later reuse.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The factory pattern is ideal for games that need to create many different objects at runtime.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In this endless shooter, the factory pattern is used to dynamically create multiple types of enemies in increasing waves of difficulty.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
By separating enemy creation from gameplay logic, the game remains modular, scalable, and easy to expand with new enemy types and behaviors.
