00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Game overview. In this game, the player's goal is to turn on all the lights on a grid in the shortest time.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There are two difficulty levels. Easy, 5x5 grid, and hard, 8x8 grid.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Each tile on the grid represents a light that can be either on or off.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The player clicks a light to toggle its state.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
However, each tile is subscribed to its neighbors.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This means that when a tile is toggled, all of its subscribed neighbors also toggle automatically.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Observer Pattern.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The observer pattern is used to manage the communication between lights without creating tight dependencies.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here's how it works in this game.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Subject, Publisher.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Each tile acts as a subject.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
When its state changes, clicked by the player, it broadcasts a notification to all tiles subscribed to it.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Observers. Subscribers.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Each neighboring tile subscribes to its neighbors' changes.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This means that when a neighbor toggles, the tile automatically responds and toggles its own state.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Tiles do not need to know about all other tiles, only their neighbors.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
When a tile is clicked, it toggles and notifies all its direct neighbors.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Each neighbor then toggles in response, but does not notify its own neighbors.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This prevents a cascading chain reaction, ensuring that a single click only affects the clicked tile and its direct neighbors, not the entire grid.
