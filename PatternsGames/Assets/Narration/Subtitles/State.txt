00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,150
Game Overview: In this game, the player controls

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,050
a thief whose goal is to reach the

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,109
top right corner of a maze without being

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:07,510
caught.

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,090
Guards patrol the maze and react dynamically to

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,970
the player's actions.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,950
Both the player and the enemies are driven

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,050
by state machines.

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,170
Player States The player character has three movement

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,610
states.

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,170
Standing, idle, walking, and running.

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,590
When no movement input is detected, the character

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,130
remains in the standing state.

14
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,210
Pressing movement keys switches the character to walking.

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,670
Holding the shift key transitions the character into

16
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,450
the running state.

17
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,770
While the player is in the running state,

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,670
stamina gradually decreases.

19
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,090
When stamina is depleted, the character automatically transitions

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,590
back to the walking state.

21
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,290
This introduces a strategic decision.

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,750
Running allows faster movement, but only for a

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,870
limited amount of time.

24
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,310
Guard States The guards in the maze are

25
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,550
also implemented using the state pattern.

26
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,110
Each guard operates independently and can be in

27
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,170
one of three states.

28
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,310
In the patrol state, guards move through the

29
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,790
maze along predefined paths, unaware of the player's

30
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,190
presence.

31
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,250
When a guard detects the player, it transitions

32
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,370
into the alarm state.

33
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,470
This state provides immediate visual feedback, shown as

34
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,610
an exclamation mark above the guard, indicating that

35
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,790
the player has been spotted.

36
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,150
After raising the alarm, the guard enters the

37
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,690
chase state.

38
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,130
In this state, the guard actively pursues the

39
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,890
player for a limited amount of time.

40
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,610
If the chase timer expires, it transitions back

41
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,570
to the patrol state.

42
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,930
State Transitions Logic Each state defines its own

43
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,550
behavior through three methods.

44
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,310
Enter, Update, and Exit.

45
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,210
The Enter method initializes the state, the Update

46
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,050
method runs every frame and checks for conditions

47
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,330
that trigger transitions, and the Exit method handles

48
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,830
cleanup before switching to another state.

49
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,090
A central state machine manages these transitions, ensuring

50
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,410
that only one state is active at any

51
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,050
given time.
