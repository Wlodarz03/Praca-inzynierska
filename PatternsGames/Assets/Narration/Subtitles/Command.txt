00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Game Overview. This game is a classic so-kebon style puzzle game. The player's goal is to push

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,400
all crates onto their designated target tiles. The player can only move crates by pushing them,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,120
which means every movement must be carefully planned.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,640
Player Actions as commands. Every player action in this game is implemented using the command

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,720
design pattern. Instead of moving the player or crates directly, each movement is wrapped inside a

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,200
command object. A command represents a single action, such as moving the player or pushing a

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,480
crate. This object knows how to execute the action and how to undo it if needed.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,640
Command Interface. All commands implement a common interface. Each command defines two core

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,040
operations, execute and undo. This ensures that every action in the game can be reversed in a

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,280
consistent way. If executing a command does not change the game state, for example, when a move

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,640
is blocked, the command is not added to the history. Command History and Invoker. A central

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,520
command invoker is responsible for executing commands and managing the command history.

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,240
Executed commands are stored in a fixed size history buffer, which keeps the last 20 actions

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,160
performed by the player. This buffer works like a circular list, allowing old commands to be

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,080
discarded as new ones are added. Undo and redo functionality. The player can use Undo and redo

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,520
at any time. Undo reverses the most recent command, while Redo reexecutes a previously undone action.

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,560
When the player performs a new action after using Undo, all future commands are not available anymore.

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,680
Visual Command History. To make the system transparent to the player, the game displays a

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,840
visual representation of the command history on screen. Up to 20 recent commands are shown,

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,440
with arrows indicating the most recently executed command and the oldest command still stored in

21
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,920
the history. This visualization helps players understand their actions and plan future moves more

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,560
effectively.
